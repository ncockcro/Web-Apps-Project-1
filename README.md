# Web-Apps-Project-1

This the first project from my Web Application Development course. The program consists of server.js which serves as the server for the web apps and uses Node.js to run. With the server running and going to localhost:3000/mailer will take you to my index.html file which is a form submission page which asks for basic contact information (I wont actually contact you). After the form is submitted, the page will load showing you the data you typed in. The user also has the option to view all of the contacts that entered their contact information.
